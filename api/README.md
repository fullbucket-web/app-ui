# FullBucket API

This is the API for the FullBucket Website.

## Running and Developing

To run locally on your machine, you'll need MongoDB and Redis setup. A very easy way to do this is with Docker. The `dev-environment.compose.yml` is a `docker-compose` script to setup all the required environments other than the API itself.
